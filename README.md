# Analyzing-loan-delinquency-using-Machine-Learning

**Abstract:**

In response to the increasing non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking sector, a research project is undertaken to establish a data-driven framework for loan approval, aimed at reducing the risk of loan delinquency. The project focuses on identifying the factors influencing loan delinquency behavior and leveraging these insights to develop an effective loan approval system. This document presents the research objectives, key questions, dataset description, domain information, methodology, and anticipated outcomes of the project.

**Introduction:**

The objective of this research project is to determine the key drivers of loan delinquency and utilize this knowledge to create a robust loan approval framework that minimizes the likelihood of delinquency. By investigating the factors contributing to loan default, the research aims to enhance risk management practices in the banking industry.

**Research Questions:**
The primary research questions that will be addressed in this project are as follows:
1. What are the underlying factors influencing loan delinquency behavior?
2. How can these factors be leveraged to develop a data-driven loan approval framework for individual customers?

**Dataset Description:**

The dataset utilized in this project comprises customer information, including unique customer IDs, delinquency status, loan term, borrower gender, age, loan purpose, home ownership status, and FICO score. The dataset can be accessed from the following source: [link to the dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

**Domain Information:**

Within the domain of risk analytics, several terms hold significance:
1. Transactor: Refers to individuals who consistently pay their dues in full and on time.
2. Revolver: Denotes individuals who make minimum payments and continue to carry a revolving balance without paying in full.
3. Delinquent: Indicates individuals who are behind on their payments, including those who fail to make even the minimum required payment.
4. Defaulter: Represents individuals who have been delinquent for a specific period, resulting in the lender declaring them in default.

**Methodology:**

The research methodology encompasses the following stages:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The dataset will undergo rigorous cleaning and preprocessing procedures to rectify errors and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory data analysis: The dataset will be thoroughly analyzed to identify relevant patterns and trends associated with loan delinquency.
3. Feature engineering: New features will be derived from the existing dataset to enhance the predictive capability of the models.
4. Model development: Multiple machine learning models will be constructed and assessed to determine the most effective model for predicting loan delinquency.
5. Model evaluation: The chosen model will be evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. Model deployment: The selected model will be deployed in a production environment to assist the bank in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

**Conclusion:**

This research project aims to establish a scientifically rigorous loan approval framework that reduces the risk of loans becoming non-performing assets (NPAs). By employing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building techniques, the project intends to develop an effective system for loan approval. The anticipated timeline for completion is six months.
